Strategy Design Pattern 

Every object is a duck . 

But we have different ducks which in turn have different behaviours in terms of flying and quacking. 

OOP Features.


Inheritance could not be used to solve this problem since inheritance does not allow loosely coupled algorithms. Inheritance will limit code reuse since each new child class will have the same flying and quacking qualities as the parent class.
    Overriding the parent class properites is an option but this is also a slippery slope which will limit the ability of similar child classes with varying properties to share commmon functionality.
